An experimental asset server for SceneJS on Node.js and CouchDB.

The server will be able to fetch files in various formats like COLLADA, OBJ etc, parse them and warehouses
them as SceneJS JSON for quick and easy download and integration into scene graphs.

The server will support query of asset metadata, and download through either HTTP or WebSocket protocol. Using the
latter, a SceneJS.Socket node will be able to dynamically pull in live content from the server.
